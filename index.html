    <h2>Day 5</h2>

    <h4>1. What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</h4>
    <p>Ans. The for..in loop in JavaScript allows you to iterate over all property keys of an object.</p>
    <pre>eg:
        for (key in object) {
            // body of for...in
        }
    </pre><hr>

    <h4>2. Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</h4>
    <p>Ans. <br> Local scope is a characteristic of variables that makes them local (i.e., the variable name is only <br> bound to its value within a scope which is not the global scope).<br><br>
        Block Level Scope: Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block. <br><br>
        function scope:Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function. <br>Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function. <br><br>
        Scope Chain means that one variable has a scope (it may be global or local/function or block scope) is used by <br> another variable or function having another scope (may be global or local/function or block scope).</p><hr>

    <h4>3. What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h4>
   <p> Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript. <br>
    Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.</p>
    <pre>Type:

        Null: Object 
        
        Undefined: undefined</pre>
    <hr>

    <h4>4. what is Symbol?</h4>
    <ul><li>symbol is the unique word</li>
    <li>symbol is primetive data type.</li>
    <li>it is introduced in Es6.</li>
    <li>it is immutable that means that cannot be change.</li>
    <li>it will given bollean values</li></ul><hr>
    
    <h4>5. Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</h4>

    <pre>
 Map is a function which is in build in function
 It has both value and index
    let arr = [1,2,3,4]
    let brr = arr.map((val,index)=>{
        return val*2
    })
    console.log(brr)

filter:
-------
it is also similar to the map
But in filter it can filter in an array
There is also a value and index is availabe but suppose we can giving an array in that we are return the value is divided by 2
In given array they can only filter and form array
    let arr = [1,2,3,5,4,6,8]

    let result = arr.filter((val,index)=>{
        
        return (val%2 ===0) 

    })
    console.log(result)
    </pre><hr>

    <h4>6. Explain passed by value and passed by reference</h4>
    <p>"Passing by value" means that you pass the actual value of the variable into the function. <br>
        "Passing by reference" means that you pass the variable itself into the function (not just the value).</p><hr>

    <h4>7. Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</h4>
<p>It is called annymous function
    self invocking function is also clled as immediately invoked function and <br> it has introduced in ES6 version.
    It should be called just after its decalartion so that it doesnot pollutes the outer scope
                (function(){})()</p><hr>
